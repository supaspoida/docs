## Information

### Project Information

Inside the ZEIT dashboard, a user can access the Addon installation inside either:

- The team or user dashboard
- Each and every project

A UiHook can identify this by looking at the `payload.projectId` property. It can then change the user interface selectively.

If the user is looking at the installation inside the main dashboard, `payload.projectId` will be empty.

### Account Information

You can access the account information of the installation inside the UiHook. Here's a list of such properties:

- `payload.userId` - The `userId` who is accessing the UiHook
- `payload.teamId` - The `teamId` of the installation if the Addon is installed for a team, otherwise empty
