## JSX

This is not a field in the payload, but what you should return as the response from a UiHook, a set of whitelisted JSX components. These components will be parsed and rendered in the ZEIT dashboard.

For security reasons, these JSX components have some minor limitations:

- No HTML elements are allowed
- Script and Style tags are not supported
- JavaScript support is disabled inside the JSX components
- Only a set of whitelisted components are supported

These limitations may seem restrictive, but with very good reason.

These limitations allow us to expose a way for you to introduce UI elements into the ZEIT dashboard without requiring manual verification.

We also provide a set of [rich components](https://www.notion.so/zeithq/Available-Components-90262f73b6d84f208bdde5c21f296c4a) that allow you to receive user inputs, implement styling and poll for changes.
