## Project Setup

### Install Node.js and Now CLI

<Note>
  If you already have the latest stable versions of Node.js and Now CLI. You can
  skip this process.
</Note>

- Download and install Node.js
- Download and install Now Desktop (which comes with Now CLI)
- Optionally you can install Now CLI via NPM: `npm install -g now`

### Add package.json

To use modules inside the UiHook, we need to create a `package.json` file. Create one with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "my-ui-hook",
  "dependencies": {
    "@zeit/addons": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Once you have created your `package.json` file, use the follow command to install the dependencies:

<TerminalInput>npm install</TerminalInput>

### Add now.json

Since we will deploy this UiHook to Now, we need to create a `now.json` file to configure the deployment. You can use this as the input when running `now dev` locally.

Create a `now.json` file and add the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "my-ui-hook",
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.js", "use": "@now/node" }]
}
```

That's all that is required for the initial project setup, next we will create a UiHook.
