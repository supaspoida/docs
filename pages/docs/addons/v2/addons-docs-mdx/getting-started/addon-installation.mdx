## Addon Installation

To install your Addon, users must visit the public URL. From there, users will have the choice of installing it to either their user or team account:

Once installed, the user will be directed back to the installation page, it will look like something like this:

/>

### Installation Location

Once installed, finding the installation is easy. It will be available in the "Installed Addons" section after selecting "Addons" from the main navigation bar.

If you are inside a project, there is a section called "Addons" as well.

Users can switch between these different installation pages via the select box shown on the top right of the installation page.

<Note>
  When the UiHook receives a request, it contains information related to the
  project being viewed currently. Based on that, your UiHook can decide what JSX
  should be sent as response.
