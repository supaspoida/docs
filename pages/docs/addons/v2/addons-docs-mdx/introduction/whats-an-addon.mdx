### What's an Addon

Before we start building our first Addon, let's find out what an Addon is:

- It's a HTTP endpoint meaning you can write it with any language you like
- You can run it locally or deploy anywhere
- The HTTP endpoint receives a [ZEIT API](/docs/api) token among other information. (For the installed user or team)
- Using our API, you can add project level environment variables and store some metadata related to the installation
- You can return `JSX` as the HTTP response to build UI elements
- You can interact with users via buttons and different input elements
- It can also work as a standard OAuth2 app
