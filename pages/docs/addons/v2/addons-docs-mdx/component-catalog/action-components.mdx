## Action Components

These components create a new UiHook request with an action that forms part of the component.

### Button

This is a key part of your UiHook. When the user clicks the button, we call your UiHook with the action attached to the button.

```jsx
<Button action="create-db">Create Database</Button>
```

The Button component supports the following props:

- `small`
- `disabled`
- `width`

### AutoRefresh

This can be use to refresh the UI by loading the UiHook again. This is useful when waiting for a background task to finish processing.

In this case, the action is always `view`:

```jsx
<AutoRefresh timeout="<timeout-in-millis>" />
```

<Note>Timeouts must be greater than 3 seconds.</Note>

### Link

You can link to an external URL. We always add `target="_blank"`:

```jsx
<Link href="https://zeit.co">Visit ZEIT</Link>
```

Or you can use an action instead:

```jsx
<Link action="doSomething">Do Something</Link>
```
