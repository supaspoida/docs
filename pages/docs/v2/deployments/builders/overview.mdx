Builders are [modules](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builders/developer-guide/) that transform your [source code into the outputs](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#sources-and-outputs), being either static files and/or [lambdas](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/), which are served by our [CDN at the edge](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/cdn/).

## When to Use Builders

If your project has source files that require transformation to be served to users, Builders enable this ability when deploying.

Whether [HTML files need to be minified](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/html-minifier-now-html-minifier), or dynamic content such as a [Node](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/node-js-now-node), [PHP](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/php-now-php), or [Go](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/go-now-go) app, need to be deployed, Builders offer the [flexibility and availability](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/developer-guide) needed to reach that goal.

## How to Use Builders

Builders can be used with Now by creating a `now.json` file in a project and then [using a `builds` property](/docs/v2/deployments/builds) within that configuration:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.html", "use": "@now/static" },
    { "src": "date.js", "use": "@now/node" }
  ]
}
```

The `builds` property is an array of objects where each object is a build step, including a `src` and a `use` property, at least.

The Builder will receive a list of files based on the `src` property's [glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) value.

## Developing your Own Builder

Extending the feature-set of a Now deployment is as simple as creating a Builder that, as previously mentioned, takes a list of files and outputs either static files or dynamic [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

[A full API reference is available to help with creating Builders.](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/developer-guide)

## Technical Details

### Caching Data

A builder can retain an archive of up to `100mb` of the filesystem at `build` time. The cache key is generated as a combination of:

- Deployment `name` (i.e., the app name)
- Team id or user id
- Entrypoint path (e.g., `api/users/index.go`)
- Builder identifier including version (e.g.: `@now/go@0.0.1`)

The cache will be invalidated if any of those items changes. The user can bypass the cache by running `now -f`.

### Limits

- Builders can run for a maximum of 5 minutes before the execution times out.
- The maximum cache archive size of a Builder is 100mb.
- The cache TTL is 7 days.
- Default lambda bundled output size is **5mb**, however, [configurable](#configuring-lambda-bundle-size).

#### Configuring Lambda Bundle Size

Each lambda output, by default, has a bundle size limit of **5mb** to [help keep cold boot times low](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#maximum-bundle-size), but can be configured up to **50mb** with the [`maxLambdaSize` config option](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#maximum-bundle-size).

The lambda threshold can also be defined by the builder that outputs the lambda (for example, [@now/go, by default, is **15mb**](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/go-now-go#maximum-lambda-bundle-size)), but the user configuration takes precedence.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.go", "use": "@now/go", "config": { "maxLambdaSize": "20mb" } }
  ]
}`}</Code>

#### Including Additional Files

Most Builders use static analysis to determine which source files should be included in the Lambda output based on the build `src` input. Any unused code or assets is ignored to ensure your Lambda is as small as possible.

In some cases, you may wish to include templates or views that are not able to be statically analyzed. Builders provide a configuration for `includeFiles` that accepts an array of globs that will always be included in the Lambda output.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.js",
      "use": "@now/node",
      "config": {
        "includeFiles": [
          "templates/**",
          "views/**"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}`}</Code>
