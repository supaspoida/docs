Builds are a step of deployments that transform sources into production ready outputs. Builds result in either **Static Files**, or [**Lambdas**](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas) (which execute code and serve a dynamic response for every request).

Builds are defined in the `now.json` configuration file using [the `builds` property](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#builds):

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "*.js", "use": "@now/node" }]
}
```

The above example instructs Now to consider all files with a `.js` extension (the pattern is defined in the `src` property) and pass them to an npm module named [`@now/node`](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/node-js-now-node).

This [`@now/node`](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/node-js-now-node) module is called a [Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview).

Builders take in all the files matched by the `src` property and transform those source files to a production-ready output.

## Sources and Outputs

**Sources** are files that already exist in your project before deploying and can be used to define the **output**.

**Outputs** are files that are used for the deployment. The **output** can be either a list of **static files**, [**Lambdas**](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas), or of both. The output is defined entirely by which, if any, [Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview) is used.

When deploying with Now, if your project has no `now.json` file, or has one but no `builds` property defined, the projects **source files** will be deployed **directly as the output**.

However, if you [define a `builds` step](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#builds), Now will only include the outputs that the Builders produce in the resulting deployment.

<Note>
  Now will only include Builder outputs as a security precaution, if there are{' '}
  <InlineCode>builds</InlineCode> defined, to avoid serving unintended files to
  the public.

## Configuration

Creating a `now.json` file in a project, as mentioned above, will allow Now deployments to utilise the source and create a production-ready output through the `builds` property.

The `builds` property is an array that contains Build steps, consisting of at least a `src` and a `use` property.

The files matched by the `src` property, as a [glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>), defined in the Build object of the `builds` property are called the **source**. The **output** is what gets generated by a [**Builder**](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview) which can consist of:

- **Static Files** - Files that are immediately available without any invocation of code.
- [**Lambdas**](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas) - Serverless functions that are invoked upon request and serve a dynamic response.

The [Builder](#builders) responsible for handling the source is defined in the `use` property, within a `build` step of the `builds` array.

## Builders

The driving force behind the Builds step of Now are the [Builders](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview). Each Builder takes the source it is given and produces an output, depending on the purpose of the builder.

### Official Builders

To get you started with your project quickly and easily, we have made a set of official Builders. You can find the full list of official builders in the sidebar to the left.

### Creating a Builder

If you would like to learn how to create a custom Builder, follow the [Builder Developer Guide](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/developer-guide).

## Parallelization

Every file matched by the `src` property (mentioned above) will trigger a new [**Build**](#sources-and-outputs). All of those **Builds** are going to run **in parallel** after the deployment is created.

This means that each [**Builder**](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview) defined in the `builds` property will run asynchronously of each other and produce their intended output without being blocked on a thread.

Ultimately, the build step will produce the output much faster than running the Builds in series.

## Build Environment Variables

Environment variables can be [passed to **builds** in the `now.json` configuration](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets/#from-now.json) file via a [`build.env` property](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#build.env).

## Limits

### Build Sources Limit

With the exception of the use of [the `@now/static` Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-now-static) – which simply allows you to move static files to the final deployment – when other Builders are in use in a configuration, Builds usage has limits based on the number of targeted [source files](#sources-and-outputs) overall for the account or team.

These limitations are based on which type of plan your account or team has:

- On the [Free](/pricing) plan, there is a limit of 32 build sources per hour and 100 build sources per day.
- On the [Unlimited](/pricing) plan, there is a limit of 512 build sources per hour and 3000 build sources per day.

To visualize this, take the following examples:

With a project that has 512 JavaScript files that are targeted by [the `@now/node` Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/node-js-now-node) in a build step within a `now.json` configuration file (with no other build steps), the deployment will be accepted but another will not be possible for an hour.

If that same project adds a build step to target a single Go file with [the @now/go Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/go-now-go), making the total [sources](#sources-and-outputs) equal 513 files, the deployment will fail as it would reach the limit of build sources.

### Builds Timeout

If a Build is in progression for 30 minutes, the Build will timeout and throw an error.
