In this guide, we will show you how to parse a [Node.js request body](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/), for use inside a [serverless function](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/), without requirinq a framework such as Express.

This guide assumes the request is sent with a [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) of [application/json](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON). However, many more content types can be parsed using the [`micro` module](https://github.com/zeit/micro).

## Step 1: Setting up the Function

To illustrate the parsing of the request body, let's take the below function as an example:

```js
const { json } = require('micro')

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  const { name } = await json(req)
  res.end(`Hello ${name}, you just parsed the request body!`)
}
```

    Node.js
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  and <GenericLink href="https://github.com/zeit/micro">Micro</GenericLink>.
</Caption>

The key part here is line 3, for those used to working with Express, it should like similar to accessing `req.body`.

## Step 2: Sending the Request

To verify that the JSON is being parsed correctly, make a POST request using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) by executing the below code inside your terminal:

<Request
  method="POST"
  url="https://req-body-micro.now.sh/"
  headers={{
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }}
  body={{
    name: 'Reader'
  }}
/>

You will receive a response like the following:

<Code>Hello Reader, you just parsed the request body!</Code>

## Step 3: Understanding Why this Works

When [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/) receives a request, the [body](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/#request-body) is in the format of a [ReadableStream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable).

To get the data from the stream, you need to listen to its `data` and `end` events. To do this requires a few lines of code which you would much rather not have to repeat.

By using [`micro`](https://github.com/zeit/micro), parsing [request bodies](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/#request-body) is made concise and straightforward as it handles everything for you, all you need to do is specify the format you want to receive the data in.
